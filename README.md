# Stock Prediction Using Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Project Description

In today's digital age, social media platforms like Twitter play a significant role in shaping public opinion and influencing market trends. This project aims to investigate the relationship between Twitter sentiment and stock price movements, specifically focusing on how public sentiment can be leveraged to predict stock prices.

### Motivation

The financial markets are often influenced by public perception, news, and social media activity. With the increasing volume of tweets related to financial markets and individual stocks, there is an opportunity to analyze this data to gain insights into market trends. By quantifying sentiment from Twitter data, we can potentially predict future stock movements, providing valuable information for investors and traders.

### Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Perform sentiment analysis on the collected tweets to classify them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments and quantify the sentiment scores.

2. **Stock Price Prediction**: Develop a predictive model that utilizes the sentiment scores, alongside traditional stock market indicators, to forecast future stock prices.

3. **Correlation Analysis**: Analyze the correlation between Twitter sentiment and stock price movements to identify trends and patterns.

4. **Visualization**: Create visualizations that illustrate the relationship between sentiment and stock prices.

### Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the Twitter data and stock market data, ensuring it is in a suitable format for analysis.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques and sentiment analysis models to extract sentiment scores from the tweets.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Engineer relevant features from both the sentiment analysis and stock market data, such as lagged prices, moving averages, and price volatility.

4. **Model Development**: Implement Deep learning models LSTM to predict future stock prices based on sentiment and other features.

5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the prediction models .

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of this project, we expect to establish a clear relationship between Twitter sentiment and stock price movements. The project will provide insights into how sentiment can be utilized as a predictor of stock prices, helping investors make more informed decisions. Additionally, visualizations and analyses will serve to illustrate the findings, contributing to the growing body of research on sentiment analysis in finance.
